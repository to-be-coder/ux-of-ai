I'm building a design system for AI interfaces.

Here's the problem. Traditional design systems were built for deterministic interfaces. You click a button, something predictable happens. AI doesn't work like that. Responses are probabilistic. Latency is variable. The output might be wrong. And the user often has no idea what's happening behind the scenes. Existing component libraries don't touch any of this.

## Why this exists

Most AI design patterns treat the user as a viewer. The AI generates, the user reads. I'm designing for something different. The user as a collaborator. The AI generates, the user steers, corrects, and fills in what's missing.

This is a work in progress. I'm designing and documenting each component in the open, starting with confidence indicators, with more to follow.
